    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, following the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). It prioritizes path-based ownership for user-specific data and leverages structural segregation to maintain a homogeneous security posture within each collection.\n\n**Authorization Independence (CRITICAL):**  Each collection representing user data (`expenses`, `categories`, `budgets`, `notifications`) is structured under the `/users/{userId}` path. This ensures that access control can be implemented based solely on `request.auth.uid` without needing to fetch parent documents. This eliminates hierarchical authorization dependencies (`get()`), crucial for atomic operations (transactions/batches) and simplifies debugging. All data for a given user is namespaced under their `uid` ensuring access rules can be written without needing to reach to other user's data or to other collections.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure allows secure `list` operations.  Because data is segregated by user ID, listing expenses, categories or budgets is always scoped to a specific `userId` and can be securely filtered in rules. There is no mixing of user data.\n\n**Invariants:** The structure supports data integrity. Path-based ownership ensures the integrity of ownership. Timestamps can be added at the application level and validated with rules. Data denormalization is not required in this simple model.\n\n**Denormalization Consideration:** In this specific case, denormalization is not necessary given the current scope of the application. All data is user-specific and there are no collaborative features requiring a membership map or other forms of shared access. If collaborative features were added, for example shared budgets, then a membership map would be required."
